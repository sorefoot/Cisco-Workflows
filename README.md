# Cisco-Workflows
Workflows created by me in the Automation Platform on the Meraki Dashboard

This is a developing space.  I will fill out information around the workflows as they progress.  These are raw and as such are still in progress.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These workflows mostly don't have validations steps and may include hard coded variables like OrgIDs or email addresses.
> Please update them and feel free to help contribute them.

Here are a list of the Workflows you can download and begin working on making better.
